# Pipelines as code

GoCD can store pipeline definitions in a source code repository (either in your application's repository, or in a separate repository). This way, you can keep your pipeline definitions out of GoCD and under version control, and manage them externally. A poller in the GoCD server will check periodically for modifications to your external pipeline definitions, and merge them with the pipeline data already present in GoCD's main XML configuration file. For a quick overview of this feature, see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfBxCWRqD8&feature=youtu.be).

_Pipelines as code_ is an optional feature. Any existing config in any GoCD server will remain valid.

_Pipelines as code_ allows GoCD to monitor and merge in external pipeline definitions located in multiple "config repositories". Pipelines from a config repository may depend on a pipeline defined in GoCD's main XML configuration file.

_Pipelines as code_ is exposed as a plugin endpoint, and so, you can write a plugin for a config repository to store pipeline configuration data in any manner you choose.

The following diagram shows how GoCD combines pipeline configuration data from multiple sources:

### A note about "Infrastructure as code"

"Infrastructure as code" is often equated exclusively to checking in configuration data to a source code repository. However, GoCD has always allowed configuration through code in various forms. For instance, [gomatic](https://github.com/SpringerSBM/gomatic), using [GoCD APIs](https://api.gocd.org/current/), [yagocd](https://github.com/grundic/yagocd), [gocd-cli](https://github.com/gaqzi/py-gocd), and more. _Pipelines as code_ is simply one more option. It makes pipeline definition more declarative, depending on the plugin, and may give more control to external mantainers.


## Available plugins for storing pipelines as code

JSON and YAML are the two formats supported currently. Refer to [JSON file configuration](https://github.com/tomzo/gocd-json-config-plugin#configuration-files) and [YAML file configuration](https://github.com/tomzo/gocd-yaml-config-plugin#setup) for more information about the file format.

The config repositories page (Admin &rarr; Config Repositories) lists existing config repositories, and allows CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) operations on them. This page also shows errors and allows you to request a check of a config repository.

### Pipeline configuration in JSON

To tell GoCD where to find the pipeline configuration files:

- Start the server
- Go to "Admin &rarr; Config repositories"

![Config repositories](../images/advanced_usage/config-repositories.png)

- Click on the "Add" button at the top right corner
- Select "JSON configuration Plugin" as the plugin ID

![Config repo json](../images/advanced_usage/config-repo-json.png)

Once you've added a config repository, you'll see new pipelines in the pipeline dashboard. If there are any errors, you'll see them on the "Config repositories" page mentioned above.


### Pipeline configuration in YAML

To tell GoCD where to find the pipeline configuration files:

- Start the server
- Go to "Admin &rarr; Config repositories"

![Config repositories](../images/advanced_usage/config-repositories.png)

- Click on the "Add" button at the top right corner
- Select "YAML configuration Plugin" as the plugin ID

![Config repo yaml](../images/advanced_usage/config-repo-yml.png)

Once you've added a config repository, you'll see new pipelines in the pipeline dashboard. If there are any errors, you'll see them on the "Config repositories" page mentioned above.


### Exporting pipeline configuration data

As of GoCD 19.1.0, you can export pipeline definitions to a format accepted by the config repository plugins (for instance, the YAML or JSON plugins). You can then check in these pipeline definitions to a source code repository and remove them from GoCD's main XML configuration file.

### Specifying Rules

Previously, adding a config repository meant delegating almost full control of GoCD to owners of configuration repositories. Creating pipelines with any name, in pipeline-groups of any name, to refer to any environment, possibly refering and maliciously extracting secrets. A breach here, by its' very design, is akin to remote code execution, in a privileged or trusted environment. As such, you must trust those with write access to configuration repositories.

Starting in GoCD 20.2.0, each configuration repository must be given explicit permissions in terms of which resources it can affect or or refer to.

The first matching rule wins.  Each rule is composed of 3 parts.

#### Directive

This is either one of `allow` or `deny`, and determines the outcome of the rule.

#### Resources

This can be any string and is meant to match on the name of resources. You can use pattern-matching.

- `*` as any wildcard.
- `?` as a one character wildcard.

    | Wildcard Matcher   | Resource names                                                                         |
    |------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `*_group`          | Matches `my_group` and `someother_group`, but not `testgroup` or `group1`.             |
    | `Production_*`     | Matches `Production_Team_A` and `Production_Team_B` but not `Team_ABC_Production_D`.   |
    | `*group*`          | Matches `group`, `my_group` and `group_A`, but not `groABCup`.                         |
    | `Team_?_group`     | Matches `Team_A_group`, `Team_B_group` but not `Team_ABC_group` or `Team__group`.      |

#### Action

The permission can only be `refer`, but the terms takes on a different meaning depending on the type of resource the rules applies to. This field is only visible in cruise-config.xml.

#### Type

Configuration repository rules can apply to any of 3 different resource types.

##### Pipeline Group

When referring a `pipeline_group`, this will allow or deny the configuration repository to create pipelines in pipeline groups that match the given name or pattern.

You will need to create at least one rule that matches *all* pipeline groups referenced in your configuration repository.

##### Pipeline

When referring to a `pipeline`, this will allow or deny the configuration repository to create pipelines that depend on other pipelines matching the resource name or pattern as materials or upstream dependency, and therefore download artifacts that pipeline may have produced.

By default, all pipelines defined in the same configuration repository will be allowed to refer (to depend) on each other without restriction. You may need additional rules to allow your pipelines to depend on other pipelines in order to build non-trivial value-stream-maps.

##### Environment

When referring to an `environment`, this will allow or deny the configuration repository to create pipelines that contain jobs referring to environments matching the resource name or pattern specified.

You will not need to define environment rules unless you make use of the feature in pipelines.

##### All

You can also refer to any resource type by speficying `*`.

#### Examples

Given the following two files in


- Config repo A
```yaml
pipelines:
  repo-a-pipeline-one:
    group: pipeline-group-a
      materials:
        git:
          type: config-repo
  repo-a-pipeline-two:
    group: pipeline-group-a
      materials:
        git:
          type: config-repo
        upstream:
          pipeline: repo-a-pipeline-one
          stage: ...
```

- Config repo B
```yaml
pipelines:
  repo-b-pipeline-one:
    group: pipeline-group-b
      materials:
        git:
          type: config-repo
  repo-b-pipeline-two:
    group: another-pipeline-group-b
      materials:
        git:
          type: config-repo
        upstream-one:
          pipeline: repo-b-pipeline-one
          stage: ...
        upstream-two:
          pipeline: repo-a-pipeline-two
          stage: ...
```


##### Without rules

```xml
<config-repo id="config-repo-a">
  ...
  <rules/>
</config-repo>
```

Without any rules, GoCD will reject the creation of pipeline because the config repo cannot refer to any pipeline group.

##### Ignore security, allow everything

```xml
<config-repo id="config-repo-a">
  ...
  <rules>
    <allow action="refer" type="*">*</allow>
  </rules>
</config-repo>

<config-repo id="config-repo-b">
  ...
  <rules>
    <allow action="refer" type="*">*</allow>
  </rules>
</config-repo>
```

GoCD will allow the creation of all pipelines.

##### Restrictively allow a non-trivial VSM

```xml
<config-repo id="config-repo-a">
  ...
  <rules>
    <!-- repo a only creates repos in `pipeline-group-a` -->
    <allow action="refer" type="pipeline_group">pipeline-group-a</allow>
  </rules>
</config-repo>

<config-repo id="config-repo-b">
  ...
  <rules>
    <!-- repo b creates a repo in `pipeline-group-b` -->
    <allow action="refer" type="pipeline_group">pipeline-group-b</allow>

    <!-- repo b also creates a repo in `another-pipeline-group-b` -->
    <allow action="refer" type="pipeline_group">another-pipeline-group-b</allow>

    <!-- repo b create a repo in that depends on a pipeline defined in another config repo so we must specify which -->  
    <allow action="refer" type="pipeline">repo-a-pipeline-two</allow>
  </rules>
</config-repo>
```
